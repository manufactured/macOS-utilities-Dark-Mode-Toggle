# macOS-utilities-Dark-Mode-Toggle

### Toggle Dark Mode on Mac  
- from Spotlight or  
- Finder window toolbar.  



#### Two types of installation

1. Unzip the premade Automator app(s) and stash them anywhere 
   - **Note**: you can open them in Automator to confirm that they include only the one command, and are safe.
2. Open the included Automator workflow and make your own App, Service, or Workflow.

### Use via Spotlight

- Just put the Automator app on your Mac, and activate it with Spotlight.  (I type  `dm` )
- I happen to use [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar)) but Spotlight, Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, etc. will obviously be fine.

### Use via Finder window Toolbar icon

- Put the Automator app somewhere on your Mac. (Make sure you choose the one with the Toolbar icon)
- Customize your Finder window Toolbar (right click on Toolbar, select "...Customize Toolbar")  
- Drag the Automator app to your Toolbar. Click done.  
- Test it by clicking the button. Dark Mode should toggle.  

















### Icons

- I recreated the iOS Dark Mode icon.   
- 
- The DarkModeIcon_Manufactured_Toolbar_ icon fits better on the Toolbar.
