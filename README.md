You can activate it most quickly from Spotlight by typing `dm`.   

(I use [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar))

You can also put it in your Finder window toolbar as button.  
Use the icon DarkModeIcon_ManufacturedToolbar.icns



How to 

Quick Start

Unzip the files you want to use (Regular or Toolbar), and store them somewhere out of the way, like your Applications folder, or a folder in your Applications folder, or anywhere else.  

Use spotlight to select "Dark Mode"













### Icons

- I recreated the iOS Dark Mode icon.   
- 
- The DarkModeIcon_Manufactured_Toolbar_ icon fits better on the Toolbar.
