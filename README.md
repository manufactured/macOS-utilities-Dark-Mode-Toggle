# macOS utilities - Dark Mode Toggle

### macOS first featured "Dark Mode" in macOS Mojave (10.14, r2018 Q3).  

**Problem**: Too many steps to activate. Open System Prefs, get to the General preference pane, then click to select 1 of 3 Appearance settings: Light (Standard) Mode, Dark Mode, or "Auto" (Change based on the time of day).  I also thought Auto lacked the fine control for varied schedules.    

**Solved**: Apple had thought of this, and released a *new Automator action* to control display modes, and now we can change modes in various ways. (from Spotlight, from the dock, from the desktop, from the Toolbar, by service, by key command, etc.).  

### This repo: Two Dark Mode toggle apps + icons copied from iOS.  
Option 1. Dark Mode Automator app using the iOS Dark Mode icon (I recreated).

<br/><br/>
<br/>
Option 2. A toolbar button version of the icon that works for me on the Finder window Toolbar.

### Install: Unzip Automator apps

The apps already have the icons attached.   

You can also make your own App, Service, or Workflow and use one of the icons.

### Option 1. Use via Spotlight

Invoke Spotlight, and type  `dm` .   

Or use other launchers: [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar) (I use), or Spotlight, Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, etc.

### Option 2. Use via Finder window Toolbar icon

1. Select the app named "Dark Mode tb" (it has bevelled button edges).
